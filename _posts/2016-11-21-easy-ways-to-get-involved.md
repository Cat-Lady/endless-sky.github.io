title: Easy ways to get involved
author: Michael Zahniser

I'm hard at work creating an entire new [alien civilization](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/commit/58fc77bca79d4517a182b6b42bd02994f4d08da7) for 0.9.5, but that's leaving me with less time for other, smaller content creation tasks. If you're interested in getting involved in creating new content, doing one of these things would be really helpful:

* Create an entire set of "Tier 2" jobs (cargo and passenger missions, starting at much higher capacities) for Wanderer space, so that they are not just reusing the human jobs.

* Or, create unique jobs for Hai space.

* "Blockade Running" missions: deliveries to frontier worlds with guaranteed pirate presence waiting for you, but no one to escort, just your own ship.

* Come up with some distinctive hails for militia ships so they don't have to share the Free Worlds ones. (Focused on defending their particular planet / system rather than on a bigger cause like opposing the Republic or helping the Free Worlds.)

* Propose new planet and spaceport descriptions - humorous descriptions of local fauna, etc.

* Find some photos (or create some 3D renders) that work well as space station interiors.

* Add running lights to various ships, using the ["blend" tool](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky-tools/blob/master/blend.cpp) to create PNGs that combine additive and alpha blending.

* Create models and sprites for outfits that add extra missile capacity of various types (javelins, meteors, etc.) based on the [existing Blender models](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B9aK8dG39P29fkdBeUJjSXJYVDdjMEpkOXh3T1NDekFYaTEtbkdTdzVwX2NTUWVVT3BUWVk).

* Outfitter sprites for the Pug outfits.

* Better sprites for planets with rings (like Saturn).
