{"name":"Endless Sky","tagline":"A space exploration and combat game similar to Escape Velocity","body":"![A fight between pirates and the Republic Navy](http://endless-sky.github.io/screenshots/fight.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Coming soon for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows.\r\nExplore other star systems. Earn money by trading, carrying passengers, or completing missions. Use your earnings to buy a better ship or to upgrade the weapons and engines on your current one. Blow up pirates. Take sides in a civil war. Or leave human space behind and hope to find some friendly aliens whose culture is more civilized than your own...\r\n\r\n(Development status, March 2015: all major aspects of game play are working, including combat, trading, the mission framework, the galaxy map, fighters, escorts, plundering and capturing ships, and sound effects. One of the three possible plot lines is done, but I plan to add an alternate ending before finalizing it. I'll probably be ready for testing in April and an official first release in May.)\r\n\r\nSee the user's manual for more information.\r\n\r\n![The trading panel (available when you land on a planet)](http://endless-sky.github.io/screenshots/trading.jpg)\r\n\r\n![The galaxy map, with the current hyperspace route shown](http://endless-sky.github.io/screenshots/map.jpg)\r\n\r\nFinding trade routes, made easy: the map view shows commodity prices for other star systems and can color them based on price, to help you decide what trade goods you should buy in the current system for sale elsewhere.\r\n\r\n![Boarding a disabled enemy ship](http://endless-sky.github.io/screenshots/plunder.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe fast, risky road to riches: disabling pirate ships, boarding them, and stealing their cargo and equipment. If you have enough crew members to pilot both ships, you can also try to defeat the enemy ship's crew and capture it. Of course, you can also plunder innocent merchant ships if that's more your style...\r\n\r\n![The job board, where you can take on new missions](http://endless-sky.github.io/screenshots/missions.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe safer way to earn a living: taking jobs carrying cargo or passengers.\r\n\r\n![The outfitter, where you can buy new equipment for your ship](http://endless-sky.github.io/screenshots/outfitter.jpg)\r\n\r\nOnce you've saved up enough money, you can spend it on upgrading your ship's equipment and weapons, or on a bigger ship.\r\n\r\n![A fleet of freighters (plus one warship escort) traveling via hyperspace](http://endless-sky.github.io/screenshots/hyperspace.jpg)\r\n\r\nA merchant fleet traveling via hyperspace. You can buy as many freighters as you want, but the larger your fleet is the more attractive it will be to pirates.\r\n\r\n![A ship under attack by alien raiders](http://endless-sky.github.io/screenshots/beams.jpg)\r\n\r\nStrange discoveries await you beyond the boundaries of known space.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
