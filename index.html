<p>Explore other star systems. Earn money by trading, carrying passengers, or completing missions. Use your earnings to buy a better ship or to upgrade the weapons and engines on your current one. Blow up pirates. Take sides in a civil war. Or leave human space behind and hope to find some friendly aliens whose culture is more civilized than your own...</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/PlayersManual">player's manual</a> for more information, or go ahead and download the beta version:<br />

<p><img src="https://endless-sky.github.io/screenshots/map.jpg" alt="The galaxy map, with the current hyperspace route shown"></p>

<p>Finding trade routes, made easy: the map view shows commodity prices for other star systems and can color them based on price, to help you decide what trade goods you should buy in the current system for sale elsewhere.</p>

<p><img src="https://endless-sky.github.io/screenshots/plunder.jpg" alt="Boarding a disabled enemy ship"></p>

<p>The fast, risky road to riches: disabling pirate ships, boarding them, and stealing their cargo and equipment. If you have enough crew members to pilot both ships, you can also try to defeat the enemy ship's crew and capture it. Of course, you can also plunder innocent merchant ships if that's more your style...</p>

<p><img src="https://endless-sky.github.io/screenshots/missions.jpg" alt="The job board, where you can take on new missions"></p>

<p>The safer way to earn a living: taking jobs carrying cargo or passengers.</p>

<p>Once you've saved up enough money, you can spend it on upgrading your ship's equipment and weapons, or on a bigger ship.</p>

<p><img src="https://endless-sky.github.io/screenshots/hyperspace.jpg" alt="A fleet of freighters (plus one warship escort) traveling via hyperspace"></p>

<p>A merchant fleet traveling via hyperspace. You can buy as many freighters as you want, but the larger your fleet is the more attractive it will be to pirates.</p>

<p>Strange discoveries await you beyond the boundaries of known space.</p>
